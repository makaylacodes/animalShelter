# Animal Shelter Dashboard
This is a dashboard for managing animal shelter data.
This program will maintain a database of animals that categorizes them by breed, age, and name based on the data provided by Grazioso Salvare and their partner animal shelters. 

## Motivation
Grazioso Salvare will use this database to identify and train dogs to become rescue search animals to help rescue humans or other animals in danger.
